               Hello, my name is Jonathan Ha and this is just a short
               <em>'About Me'</em> page. I was born and raised in
               Singapore and recently graduated from college with a
               <em>'Bachelor of Business in Marketing'</em> degree. After
               working on some of my coursework, I realised that I had a real
               interest in data science and I wanted to pursue a career in it.
               However, I may have picked the wrong major and the skills
               I had as an aspiring data analyst was limited, thus,
               with my natural curiosity and determination to achieve my goals
               I decided to do some research and that brought me to enroll
               in the <em>'Intro to Programming'</em> nanodegree by Udacity. Thus, I also
               want to thank Udacity for this opportunity that hopefully takes me
               one step closer to my goals!
